While bringing a pot of water, with a pinch of salt and a dash of olive oil, to boil,
melt a cup of butter into a pint of heavy whipping cream in a sauce pan, before tossing in a box (24 oz) of fettuccine pasta into the pot
When the butter has melted, dump in 3/4 cup each of grated parmesean, romano, and mozzerella cheeses.
Stir the sauce constantly, to avoid burning.
When the cheese has melted in the sauce, season it with garlic salt, pepper, basil, oregano, and rosemary. And then stir in the cooked chicken.

Serve the sauce over the pasta, with a sprig of parsley on top, and a glass of wine.
